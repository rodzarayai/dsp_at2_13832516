## Description
The Currency Conversion App uses the Frankfurter API to retrieve the conversion rates between two currency codes on a certain date. The user can choose between the latest available rate and any historical date in the past ten years. The app provides a user-friendly interface using Streamlit and includes visualizations of exchange rates for the last 30 days for any selected date.
    
### Challenges:

* Implementing error handling for API responses and making the user experience smooth when dealing with unexpected errors (e.g., Set an initial amount to xchange and diffferent curriencies).

    
### Future Implementations:
